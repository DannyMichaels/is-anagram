# is-anagram
 In language of your choosing write a program with a single function to determine if 2 strings supplied by the user are anagrams.  Make the program as robust as possible to accommodate imperfect user input.  The interface should prompt the user to:  “Enter a string and Press Enter”   (wait for user input)  “Now enter another string”  (wait for input)  Display True if the 2 strings are anagrams, false if not, display an error message if the function could not complete.       Then start over.
